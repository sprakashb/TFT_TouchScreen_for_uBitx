# TFT_TouchScreen_for_uBitx with CAT, Split and UP/Down Scan
A Touch screen and colour TFT for uBitx (version 2.9). Now with CAT and Split functionality is further enanced with auto scan in Up/Down directions.

A small PCB is designed for connecting the uBitx with Arduino Mega 2560 having a MCUFriend 2.4 inch TFT display and Touch Screen. The circuit diagram and PCB are created in KiCad. PCB pattern for heat transfer is given along with a overlay. This being first version of PCB, some variations are expected in future updates. All CB related files in PCB folder.

All sketches needed to run the TFT VFO Program are uploaded here in ArduinoSketch folder. All *.ino files should be copied into a directory and invoked using Arduino IDE.
