# TFT_TouchScreen_for_uBitx
A Touch screen and colour TFT for uBitx (beta version)

A small PCB is designed for connecting the uBitx with Arduino Mega 2560 having a MCUFriend 2.4 inch TFT display and Touch Screen. The circuit diagram and PCB are created in KiCad. PCB pattern for heat transfer is given along with a overlay. This being first version of PCB, some variations are expected in future updates.

All sketches needed to run the TFT VFO Program are uploaded here. All *.ino files should be copied into a directory and invoked using Arduino IDE.
